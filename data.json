      "Description": "The Pilgrimage starts at the sleepy hamlet of Garnett Bridge just 5 miles North of Kendal. There is limited parking here, so it's best to get dropped off, or park just past the junction of the Longsleddale road and the A6 at the designated parking place, and walk down the fields to the bridge. Come and sign in at Cragg Cottage.\n\nThe route starts with an easy valley walk, to a pool after 0.5km. Take the path above Bridge End that rises onto the moor towards Brunt Knott. After a short distance, a view opens up of Harter Fell at the head of the valley. From here, a boggy path leads through the bracken and grass, before turning up towards the summit of Brunt Knott and another impressive view. Retrace your steps for a short way, then follow the large track down to the farm and onwards over Staveley Head Fell to Green Quarter. Maggs Howe offers camping barn accommodation.\n\nThere's little in the hamlet of Kentmere apart from the church of St Cuthberts. A private road leads up the valley past the old green slate mines to the reservoir at the valley head. "

      "Description": "You will need to climb to reach the Ull Stone which lies a little way off the path. There is a legend that the giant Ull threw it here, but today it is used for bouldering. \n\nBack on the main path, ascend to the pass of Nan Bield where you will find a well-built shelter, handy for taking a break. The rough path descends to Small water, a water between Harter Fell and Mardale Ill Bell. The large path is followed to the road-head which marks the Southern end of Haweswater. You are unlikely to be alone as you follow the lake round, but the view when you reach the crest of the Rigg is stupendous. Walk down to the RSPB Bird Hide just a little way up Riggindale. The Golden eagle is thought to have disappeared now, but you may well see other birds of prey on the rough, pathless wander up Riggindale. \n\nThe route up Short Stile is all too obvious, it is steep and unforgiving up trackless grassy slopes, but it does take you into a wild ampitheatre. The toil does end (eventually) to cross the old Roman Road of High Street to the little top of Knott. Our route takes us across the main ridge and past Hayeswater to Hartsop where there is a public car park. Shortly you will arrive at another car park by Brotherswater. At Hartsop Hall you could take the track to the campsite next to the Brotherswater Inn where refreshment and accommodation await. For those continuing, a path slants up through natural woodland. I prefer the upper path rather than the valley bottom one, as this offers the better views.\n\nOnce you reach the uppermost cove below the Hart Crag/Dove Crag Ridge, look for a small path rising left from a large boulder. This takes you to the Priest's Hole, a small cave under an overhang on Dove Crag. There's a visitors book and it can be busy. A wall provides shelter and the location beneath the great overhang of Dove Crag is spectacular. If you are lucky, it’s a wonderful place to see the sun rise to the East."

      "Description": "From Priest’s Hole descend to the cove and cross the ridge of Hartsop above How to descend to Greenhow end. The scramble ends on a stony ridge which you follow to the main path taking you to the summit of Fairfield. Cofa Pike is worth the detour for the view back toward Greenhow End. From the col between Fairfield and Cofa Pike, descend the slanting, scree laden path to the tarn. Just off the path below the outflow of the tarn is the Brothers Parting Stone. An inscribed stone marks the place at which William Wordsworth last saw his brother John.*\n\nAfter following the path toward Glenridding a little way, ascend steeply up the broken ground to reach Cock Cove. There's a short ascent to the narrow little ridge of the Tongue with a rough descent to Ruthwaite Cove. This cove is a wild place surrounded by broken cliffs. At its Northern edge, a stream is followed to reach Hard Tarn, a tiny lake kept in place by a glacial slab. Take a rightward slanting line from here to avoid the steepest ground until you reach the East Ridge of Nethermost Pike. Despite the crowds, Striding Edge is always worthwhile. Keep to the crest to enjoy it to the full. It’s a very easy scramble, but for those of a nervous disposition, Swirral Edge offers an alternative way down to Red Tarn. \n\nThe motorway like path from here takes you to the cottages and huts by the mines. Helvellyn Youth Hostel is a short distance down the track toward Glenridding, or continue on a three kilometre diversion into Glenridding village for the range of accommodation and refreshments available. Otherwise take the Sticks Pass path past the disused lead mines of Greenside.\n\nThe path that leads to Aira Force traverses steep hillsides. You'll pass Lyulph's Tower as you walk towards the memorial Seat. You may want to stop for refreshments at the Royal Hotel at Dockray."

The exit up Foule Crag can be slippery and unpleasant but the scramble can be avoided in its entirety by taking the path up Scales Fell from the tarn.\n\nAnother rocky ridge leads down (Hallsfell) to Threlkeld and this can be slippery when wet. Refreshments can be taken in the village or you can continue along small roads to the campsite at Burns Farm. A combination of small roads and paths lead to the Castlerigg Stone Circle, one of the earliest stone circles in Britain and possibly in Europe. "

A path to the South West allows a more moderate descent to the lakeside path that passes Friars Crag. This is a good place to amble as there are parks that lead into the great capital of gear and tea shops that is Keswick.\n\nContinue ambling toward Braithwaite where there is a good campsite. The route follows a natural ridge line from Barrow to Grasmoor and from there over Whiteless Pike and down to the inviting village of Buttermere. \n\nIf you're strong, the run off Whiteless Pike can be exhilarating and fast. Buttermere offers a range of accommodation options including youth hostel, campsite, hotels and bed & breakfasts. If you get there in time, Syke Farm teashop serves delicious ice-cream made from their own cows. The village also has a small church with a memorial to Alfred Wainwright below one of the windows. "

      "Description": "The next section starts with a walk by Buttermere Lake, before rising steeply into Birkness Combe. This is the haunt of rock climbers and if it’s reasonably dry offers a route up Grey Crags for the scrambler. This is at the limit of scrambling and is actually graded as a Diff rock climb, so unless you are confident, you will need a rope and a companion.\n\nIt is pretty impossible to get up the little chimney on Harrow Buttress with a large backpack, so I recommend leaving the sack at the bottom or hauling up this bit. Alternatively, you can take the climbers descent path up the scree that borders the climbs or ascend the steep slope to High Stile before you get to the crags, although its worth entering the combe to experience the wild ambience.\n\nOnce on top, follow the well frequented path over High Crag and Haystacks to Innominate Tarn, Wainwright's favourite place and where his ashes were scattered. Once past Blackbeck Tarn, take a small path toward Warnscale Head Bothy which is an old quarryman's hut with a tremendous view over Buttermere. The bothy is very small so you should take a tent or use the nearby bothy of Dubs Hut if you plan to stay.\n\nWhichever path you take you'll end up at Gatesgarth, and thence Buttermere Lake. The ascent of Robinson from Hassness is hard-going if you take the path, and the scramble up the gill to its left is scarcely less arduous but can be a real clamber in a Garden of Eden. Instead of following the ridge all the way to Dale Head, the route drops down the Northern ridge of Hindscarth to arrive at Low Snab. Here you can move onto Newlands Church.*\n\nPassing the car park at Little Town, and the mine workings of Yewthwaite lead mine, head out and back to Cat Bells. Despite the people it’s an attractive little summit. Then it’s down to Grange, to break for refreshment."

      "Description": "Castle Crag may lack height, but it makes up for it in character. If you continue near the river you can access caves, once the home of the self-styled 'Professor of Adventure', Millican Dalton. In Rosthwaite there are a few shops and a bit further on is one of my favourite youth hostels, YHA Borrowdale. If you carry on along the riverside path, you cross the river and follow the path toward Glaramara. If you fancy the scramble, leave the path when it rises up the hillside away from the stream and instead, follow the valley up to Dovenest Crag for a singular up and down scramble to a cave. This can be followed by another scramble up to Rosthwaite Fell and from there make sure not to get lost on the bumpy ground to High House Tarn.\n\nAfter Allen Crags, the route joins the motorway at Esk Hause which passes Sprinkling Tarn. At Sty Head you take the rather indistinct track slanting upwards that leads to Kern Knotts and the Napes. This is a spectacular traverse beneath cliffs taking you passed the famous Needle and Sphinx rock, before rising up past Sphinx Rock to another scramble - Pinnacle Ridge of the Westmorland Crags. This leaves you just short of Great Gable itself. Alternatively you could walk up the Breast Track to the summit of Gable.\n\nMore scree takes you to the aptly named Windy Gap and you can then descend over to the North West ridge of Green Gable, or else take in the summit and descend the ridge from the top. In any event, you'll end up at Black Sail Hostel, which is the Lake District's only true mountain hut. Book in advance to be sure of a place."

      "Description": "From Black Sail Hostel, you could ascend to Black Sail Pass and follow the High Level Route to Robinsons Cairn, but despite the difficulty, I recommend walking down the valley and crossing a little bridge to ascend directly to the bottom of Pillar Rock. This shows the full extent and power of the rock which soars above the valley. It’s a bit hard going but eventually relents to make a spectacular walk to the left of the Rock. When you hit the path from Robinsons Cairn, follow it to the gap by Pillar Rock and go up and down Slab & Notch to the top. \n\nIf you have a rope you can abseil down to Jordan Gap, but otherwise you must come down the same way you came. If you don't fancy the scramble up Pillar Rock, a much easier scramble can be taken up Pisgah, the pinnacle before the gap. You'll probably not want to hang around on the bald summit so continue on the stony ridge to Scoat Fell and make sure that you go over to Steeple. The hills get more rounded and less rocky as you leave Scoat Fell towards Wastwater. \n\nYou’ll reach the road at Greendale, home and farm of the most famous fell runner in Britain, Joss Naylor. You will pass the youth hostel, where a steep ascent of the Screes awaits. Its a stiff pull but there are great views of Wasdale. Before you arrive at the head of the valley, you'll pass the National Trust campsite, follow the road to the pub rather than the footpath, unless you want wet feet! you can stop off at the Wasdale Head Inn for a hot meal and a beer.

      "Description": "My favourite way up Scafell Pike is Piers Gill. The gill is a Severe climb but there's a path to the side. It's the most spectacular ravine in the District which splits the hillside up to Lingmell. You can follow the path up to the large cairn on Scafell Pike, but if you're a climber and have a rope, why not drop down below Pikes Crag and tackle Crenation Ridge, a 'Diff' climb that takes an obvious arete up Pikes Crag to finish on Pulpit Rock. \n\nOnce beyond Mickledore you can drop down to the East before reaching the gully and stream that rise to Foxes tarn, but preferable is the route up Lords Rake and Deep Ghyll. The scramble takes you into grand surroundings, especially if you make the detour to the top of Scafell Pinnacle. Descend into Eskdale and Sampsons Stones at the bottom. It's a boggy walk to Lingcove Beck but at the packhorse bridge, the trail improves. The bridge is a special place on a sunny day with an idyllic pool beckoning. The sheepfold by the bridge makes a great campsite.\n\nOnce you reach the road, turn left up to Hard Knott Fort before scrambling up Harter Fell, an isolated, excellent viewpoint. The way to Wallowbarrow wouldn't make anyone's top ten walks, but the crag itself is set in a fine location and is a popular haunt of rock climbers. Call in at the Newfield Inn for a pint in the bucolic loveliness of the Duddon valley. There's a good campsite just up the road and a camping barn near Wallowbarrow. "

You can either walk up Grey Friar on a small path or continue along the tarn and scramble up Great Blake Rigg. From there, its a high level ridge passing the remains of a crashed plane near Great Carrs. Continue with a scramble that scales the ramparts of Dow Crag via a climber's descent route, or else you can simply walk along the ridge to the summit. \n\nThere are better scrambling routes but these are likely to prove too difficult with a large pack, but if you're out for the day, Giant's Crawl or one of the buttress routes would provide a finer route to the top. Rather than descending the normal route from Coniston Old Man, reverse your steps to Brim Fell and descend rough ground to Levers water and the ambience of the combe and aptly named Boulder Valley that leads down to the Miners Bridge. Cross to Tilberthwaite, a rather lovely gorge, and Cathedral Cave, an impressive cavern near Little Langdale. It’s worth the detour to the Three Shires Inn."

The former is a singular little summit that's worth the brief detour before dropping down to the Old Dungeon Ghyll for well earned refreshment. There's a campsite here as well as hotel accommodation.\n\nFrom the Old Dungeon Ghyll, take the path by Dungeon Ghyll if you don't fancy the scramble up the West Face. Otherwise go up Mickleden and Troughton Beck and then traverse to the base of the exposed scramble up the face of the Pike. This is superbly situated and lands you on the knobbly little summit which is one of the most distinctive points of the District. The way to Harrison Stickle is obvious, or rather better is the scramble up the face a little way further right. For a different experience, you can descend from Pavey Ark by the exposed groove of Jack's Rake, but if this isn't for you, the path to the East provides an alternative. Crossing the ridge to Easedale takes you into Wordsworth country and Grasmere. There's a youth hostel in the village but if the weather is fine, ascend the path to Alcock Tarn for a night above the lights of the village.\n\nAs you descend from Alcock Tarn you pass the summit of Butter Crags on the path down to White Moss Common. Follow the old coffin road from Grasmere to Rydal. Rydal Hall offers a peaceful place to sit and reflect, there's also a campsite as well as hotel accommodation and a tea shop by the waterfall."

There's plenty of accommodation and food options in Windermere, as well as a train station. We immediately cross the road passed a housing estate and on to School Knott, from where the Dales Way takes us to Staveley. The terrain is undulating and unspectacular, but makes a very pleasant walk through the fields. In Staveley is Wilfs Cafe, an artisan bakery and the Hawkshead Brewery Hall, where you can buy yourself a treat. Cross the river on a footbridge and join the small road past Cragg Wood. It's worth a diversion into the natural woodland before continuing on to Potter Tarn and Gurnal Dubs. \n\nThe main path winds down to the South East, but a better end is to take the indistinct path North East from the stile at the South East end of the tarn and across to Ulgraves, a nice little summit and viewpoint over Longsleddale. Head South from the summit to a gate and keep left of the lovely tarns before crossing the wall by a stone stile.  \n\nGo from here to Carl Crag and make your way to the deer fence. You can carry on down by the side of the fence to cross the wall to the road or else weave circuitously through the wood to end at Garnett Bridge.\n\nOnce you’ve completed all the stages don’t forget to pop in to see John Fleetwood at Cragg Cottage, Garnett Bridge to have Cream Tea."
